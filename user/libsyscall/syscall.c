 *   You should probably NOT EDIT THIS FILE in any way!

 *   You should probably DELETE this file, insert all of your
 *   Project 2 stub files, and edit config.mk accordingly.
 *
 *   Alternatively, you can DELETE pieces from this file as
 *   you write your stubs.  But if you forget half-way through
 *   that that's the plan, you'll have a fun debugging problem!
